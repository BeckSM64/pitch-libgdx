## Running the project
This project is far from complete, but if you'd like to play around with it, the easiest way to run the project is using Gradle. Make sure Gradle is installed and can be run from the command line. Navigate to the root folder of the project and execute the command
```
gradlew desktop:run
```
and the project should run. Have fun :)
